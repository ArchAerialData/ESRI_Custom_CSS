# Examples Directory

This directory contains example HTML files generated by the Terra Model Viewer Generator.

## Structure

```
examples/
├── example-obj-viewer.html      # Sample OBJ embedded viewer
├── example-ply-viewer.html      # Sample PLY embedded viewer
└── screenshots/                 # Screenshots of example viewers
    ├── obj-viewer.png
    └── ply-viewer.png
```

## Purpose

These example files demonstrate:
- What the final output looks like
- How to interact with the 3D viewer
- File size and performance characteristics
- Browser compatibility

## Usage

Simply open any `.html` file in a web browser to view the embedded 3D model.

**Features**:
- Mouse controls (rotate, zoom, pan)
- Reset camera button
- Wireframe toggle
- Lighting presets
- Screenshot export

## File Sizes

Example files are intentionally small (<10MB) for quick loading and demonstration purposes.

For real-world Terra models, file sizes may be larger (see implementation plan for recommendations).

## Notes

- Example files are generated automatically by the application
- Not committed to repository (see `.gitignore`)
- Replace with your own generated examples for testing
